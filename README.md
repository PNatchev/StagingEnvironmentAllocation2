# StagingEnvironmentAllocation2


The application produces an app like command line interface that allows you to register yourself
for an available staging environment. Once the engineer is complete with their work they can select
the unregister option which will release the staging environment back to the queue for the next
engineer to use. If a priority 1 occurs the last option can be selected which will allow you to
bypass the queue and will provide the current user a 30 minute warning to unregister.

## Usage

If the solution is open in Visual Studio 2019 press the green play button titled 
StagingEnvironmentAllocation2 to use the application you can reference GreenPlay.png in the Images folder.

You can also launch the executible from within the Debug\net5.0 path of the solution - example below
StagingEnvironmentAllocation2\StagingEnvironmentAllocation2\bin\Debug\net5.0
